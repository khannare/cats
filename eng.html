        <h1>Which Cat Suits An Energetic Personality?</h1>
        <p>The Japanese bobtail would be the best. After a luxurious existence as royalty's pets, the Japanese bobtail was forced to work. Mice were threatening Japan's major source of revenue at the time, so the emperor sent them out into the woods to hunt them down. The "Cat Who Saved Japan" is how they're known. After recovering their rightful place as house kings and queens, the Japanese Bobtails have plenty of energy left over. They can play fetch or tag if there are other cats in the house.</p>
