        <h1>What Is an Affectionate Personality?</h1>
        <p>People who are affectionate tend to show love or fodness for others around them. They are devoted to spread love around them, by doing simple things such as hugging or taking care of you.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Which Cat Suits an Affectionate Personality?</h1>
        <p>The best option would be the Maine Coon breed. They first began living with humans approximately 5,000 years ago in Cyprus, but the men began to breed intentionally only during the 1800s. Since they have mainly lived between wild and tamed in a grey region. While some may need less care, there are significant differences across races: While some people are glad to spend the day on their own, while other people spend so much time with the human beings that they will practically follow you into the shower.</p>
