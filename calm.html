        <h1>What Is a Calm Personality?</h1>
        <p> A calm person does not show or feel any worry, anger, or excitement. Calm people don't endlessly anticipate problems. They promptly deal with problems once they occur rather than putting off handling issues. People who are bad at coping with stress tend to do a lot of worrying about problems before they happen, and then avoid dealing with problems that have actually occurred. </p>
